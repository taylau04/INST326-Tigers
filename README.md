Interpretting output of the program 
Our program consists of three sections: comparing two NBA players (compare_players), displaying best 
NBA teams (show_best_teams), and data visualization of player stats (player_stats_by_team). 
* compare_players
  * The comparing two NBA players returns an output of the player 1 and player 2's grade and scaled score. 
  The method will then display which player has a higher score. 
* show_best_teams
  * This section will display a df of top teams based on a certain statistic that the user inputs. 
* player_stats_by_team 
  * This will output a data visualization consisting of players from a chosen NBA team and a chosen statistic 
  based on the user's input.

Before we learned about seaborn, I asked special permission from Aric to research how to create barplots and customize them for our project evaluation check in as at the time my only function at the time was a data visualization function. I used these websites to help me understand how to create a barplot, add titles to the x and y axis, and graph a dataframe.

This dataset provided us with extensive statistics for NBA players during the 2023–2024 regular season. The columns consist of the player's name, positions, team, assists, steals, blocks, etc. This CVS code is first opened, read through, and irritated through in order to read the stats of NBA players and teams. These stats are used throughout the entire code to compare players, show top teams, and to create a Pandas DataFrame
